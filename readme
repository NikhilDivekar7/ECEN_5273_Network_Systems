This is Programming assignment 1.

This assignment concerns with socket programming with server-client model which provides various option such as get the file, put the file, delete the file, list the files, and exiting process.

The reliable transmission is achieved by using ack-nack in stop and wait protocol.

I have server and client in 2 different folders

The executable can be run as follows:
server: ./server 5001
client :./client 127.0.0.1 5001

For testing purpose of get I used abc.png ==> get abc.png
For testing purpose of put I used abcd.png ==> put abcd.png
